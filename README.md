CEO and founder of learningcut.com
Learningcut platform is used by hundreds of online instructors, who offer classes in a wide range of different fields, from 3D AND ANIMATION to programming. The instructors can now be paid in cryptocurrency using Learningcut e-commerce platform, alongside credit cards, debit cards and PayPal, with the cryptocurrency being immediately converted to fiat at the time of the transaction. The decision to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency as a form of payment was simple. Driven by instructor requests, ease of integration, and the international nature of our business.
